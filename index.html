        <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>My name is Alexander, I am a Sophmore at UCR majoring in political science. Before UCR I lived in LA. I went to Highschool
            at Culver City High School. I have been a UCR student for 2 years. I work at the dining hall, typically washing dishes.</p>
            <p>I like to call with my friends and also watch history videos on youtube. I also like listening to music and keeping up with my favorite artists. My unique skill is that I can make a weird popping sound by pressing my elbow inward into my chest.</p>

        <h3>My Hometown</h3>
            <p>I grew up in Culver City in an apartment with my mother and twin brother. There is 
                 a park across the street where we would often go to chill. The culture is just average
                 california stuff like malls and whatnot, however there was this guy who ran street pizza
                 and that was pretty cool. The best season is winter because I like wearing jackets.</p>

        <h3>Interests and Hobbies</h3>
            <p>My mom knows a bunch of swahili dishes since her parents were born in Tanzania, so sometimes she
                    teaches me. My favorite dish to make with her is mandazi and warak anab. I also like listening to
                    rap and comparing different artists. Top two are MFDOOM and Kanye (his personality sucks I know)</p>

        <h3>UCR</h3>
            <p>I like hanging out with my friend, he likes to go on hikes but with the riverside heat it is not always
            optimal. I have never been to the botanical gardens but it is something I want to do sometime. Something I 
            value is the 24hr library during finals week. I wish it was always 24hr but I understand finding
            staff willing to work those hours must be hard. Other than that I just like walking around campus listening 
            to music.</p>

        <h4>Bell Tower</h4>
        <section>
            <img src="download (8).jpeg" alt="bell tower">
            <p>The <a href="https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Riverside_CA" target="_blank">bell tower</a> is at the middle of the school and rings its bell every hour. It is very tall and has an interesting
            design. When I first came to campus it was a nice reference point for whenever I got lost. It is probably the thing
            that UCR is most known for.</p>

        <h4>Orbach Library</h4>
        <section>  
            <img src="download (7).jpeg" alt="Obarch Library">
            <p><a href="https://library.ucr.edu/libraries/orbach-science-library" target="_blank">Obarch Library</a> is
            a place for students to study at UCR. I like it because of its reservable study rooms and access to computers. The first floor
            is open for talking, and the second floor is quiet, so you can go futher up if you are studying alone. Also, it is open 24hrs
            on finals week, so it is my go to for late night studying before the quarter ends.</p>

        <h4>Olmsted Hall</h4>
        <section>
            <img src="download (9).jpeg" alt="Olmsted Hall">
            <p><a href="https://library.ucr.edu/libraries/orbach-science-library" target="_blank">Olmsted Hall</a> is the base for statistics at UCR, and has an extense array of books. It is also right next to this class.
            I think it is interesting because it has a really creppy bastement area that a lot of people say is haunted, it just looks really
            weird but I kinda like exploring it. Other than that it is just an ordinary building for classrooms and stuff.</p>
